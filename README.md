# Health Information System

This is a Python program to manage patient health records. You can:
- Store and read patient data from a file.
- View patient visits for all patients or a specific patient.
- See average health stats and find patients who may need follow-up.
- Track monthly visit trends to know when patients come most often.
- Add or delete patient records easily with a menu-driven system.

Itâ€™s simple, interactive, and shows how to handle real patient data in Python.
